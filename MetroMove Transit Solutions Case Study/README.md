## Project Overview
MetroMove Transit Solutions is a public transportation service provider operating in multiple cities. They manage and analyze thousands of daily trips taken via buses, trains, ferries, and trams. The company's mission is to provide efficient, affordable, and timely public transportation services while leveraging data to improve passenger experience and optimize operations.

## Project Objective
MetroMove has collected a large volume of trip data but lacks insights into trip performance, passenger behavior, and fare patterns due to messy, inconsistent, and incomplete records. As part of their new data-driven initiative, they seek to clean, explore, and summarize their trip records to identify inefficiencies and patterns that can drive operational improvements

## Data Source
